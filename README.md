# Movie-Review-Summarization-Using-Graph-Based-Ranking-Algorithm
Several users post bulk reviews on movie review websites such
as IMDB on daily basis.
These involve user attitude towards a specific movie. Thus,
automatically mining and summarizing these bulk reviews is
desirable.
This project proposes a review mining and summarization
(RMS) approach that integrates supervised ML approach with
graph-based ranking algorithm to automatically generate a
generic summary of movie reviews
